In this project, we analyze Walmart sales data with a focus on **Market Basket Analysis**. The objective is to identify product associations, popular product combinations, and sales patterns based on the time and day of the week. The analysis includes the following three main components:

## 1. Top 3-Product Combinations

- We aim to find frequently occurring product pairs and extend them to identify a third most associated product. For each product, the goal is to determine its best pairing (e.g., *bread* is often bought with *milk*) and the most frequent third item in the basket (e.g., *cheese* is often added with *bread* and *milk*).
- Using this information, we calculate the probability of these pairs and triples appearing together in a single transaction.

## 2. Top Product Combinations by Hour

- We analyze product sales across different hours of the day to identify the top three products sold during each hour.
- This allows us to understand hourly sales trends and optimize inventory or promotions based on peak product demand throughout the day.

## 3. Top Product Combinations by Day of the Week

- We examine product sales for each day of the week to identify the three most popular products sold on each day.
- This analysis helps to uncover daily sales patterns, supporting inventory and promotional planning tailored to weekly demand cycles.

Each part of the analysis will be visualized in a dedicated dashboard page, enabling data-driven insights to optimize sales strategies, improve customer experience, and support inventory planning.
